# Diabetes Genes and Kidney Rejection

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook analyzing the relationship between selected genetic variants and the risk of kidney rejection in patients with diabetes.

## Repository Contents

* **`diabetes_genes_and_kidney_rejection.ipynb`**: Jupyter Notebook with code, figures, and results.
* **`README.md`**: Project description and usage instructions.
* **`requirements.txt`**.

## Background

Genetic factors such as variants in genes involved in immune regulation and insulin signaling may play a role in post-transplant diabetes and kidney rejection. This notebook explores the distribution of selected genes, evaluates differences between groups, and tests predictive models.

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/diabetes-genes-kidney-rejection.git
   cd diabetes-genes-kidney-rejection
   ```
2. Open the notebook with Jupyter:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook diabetes_genes_and_kidney_rejection.ipynb
   ```

## Requirements

* Python 3.x
* Jupyter Notebook
* Dependencies:

  * pandas
  * numpy
  * matplotlib
  * scikit-learn

You can install them with:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Outputs

The notebook generates:

* Histograms of gene distributions between groups
* ROC curves for predictive models
* Accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity metrics

All outputs are embedded directly in the `.ipynb` file and viewable on GitHub.
